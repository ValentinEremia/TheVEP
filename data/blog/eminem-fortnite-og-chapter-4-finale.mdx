The [leaks](https://www.dexerto.com/fortnite/eminem-fortnite-live-event-and-skin-leaked-for-chapter-4-finale-2393291/) were true: Eminem is coming to _Fortnite_ as part of the game’s Chapter 4 finale. [Epic Games has confirmed](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cz89v4zM7-a/?igshid=N2ViNmM2MDRjNw%3D%3D) Eminem will appear during the live finale, while players will get to purchase a few different skins modeled after the rapper.

[_Fortnite_’s finale event, called The Big Bang](https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/21/23970772/fortnite-big-bang-live-event-date), kicks off on December 2nd at 2PM ET. In an [updated page](https://www.fortnite.com/news/the-big-bang-event-a-new-beginning-for-fortnite-on-december-2) on _Fortnite_’s website, developers say you can “watch Eminem... as Eminem” during the event, which marks the end of the [_Fortnite_ OG chapter](https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/6/23948555/fortnite-og-new-season) that brought the game back to its roots. _Fortnite_ is calling this event a “new beginning” for the game, potentially hinting at a new island.

Meanwhile, _Fortnite_ is releasing three skins — Rap Boy, Slim Shady, and Marshall Never More — that players can purchase from the item shop starting November 29th at 7PM ET. By attending the event, players can unlock The Big Bang loading screen and the Marshall Magma Style for the Marshall Never More outfit, giving Eminem glowing eyes and fiery skin.

This latest collaboration sounds a lot like the performance [Travis Scott held in _Fortnite_ in 2020](https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report), which [more than 12 million people attended](https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233946/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-record-breaking-player-count). Eminem’s appearance might attract even more viewers, though, [given the popularity of _Fortnite_ OG](https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/5/23947197/people-are-pretty-into-fortnite-og).
