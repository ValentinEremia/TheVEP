To simplify:\n\nAccordion = Title (always visible) + Description (reachable via action).\n\nUnlike the many other tutorials on building a responsive accordion, we at Cruip will focus on **creating an essential animated and accessible accordion using just Tailwind CSS classes**, and we will also show you how to create similar reusable components in React and Vue.\n\nIf you’ve previously come across our [Tailwind CSS templates](https://cruip.com/), you probably know we use accordions extensively. If you’re interested in seeing some of them in action, please take a look at our [elegant HTML website template](https://cruip.com/tidy/), or our [simple website template](https://cruip.com/simple/).\n\nQuick navigation\n\n-   [HTML version](https://dev.to/cruip_com/building-a-simple-animated-accordion-component-with-tailwind-css-2af7#HTML%20version)\n-   [Nextjs version](https://dev.to/cruip_com/building-a-simple-animated-accordion-component-with-tailwind-css-2af7#Nextjs%20version)\n-   [Vue version](https://dev.to/cruip_com/building-a-simple-animated-accordion-component-with-tailwind-css-2af7#Vue%20version)\n\nCurious to see how it works? Let’s let’s jump right in!\n\n___\n\n## [](https://dev.to/cruip_com/building-a-simple-animated-accordion-component-with-tailwind-css-2af7#creating-the-accordion-in-html)Creating the accordion in HTML\n\nLet’s kick things off with a **new HTML document**. To keep it simple, we’ll import Tailwind CSS using the CDN. Here’s the snippet:  \n\n```\n  <!DOCTYPE html>\n  <html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n      <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n      <title>Animated Accordiom</title>\n      <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1\">\n      <link rel=\"preconnect\" href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com\">\n      <link rel=\"preconnect\" href=\"https://fonts.gstatic.com\" crossorigin>\n      <link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;600;700&display=swap\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n      <script src=\"https://cdn.tailwindcss.com\"></script>\n      <script defer src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@alpinejs/focus@3.x.x/dist/cdn.min.js\"></script>\n      <script defer src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/alpinejs@3.x.x/dist/cdn.min.js\"></script>\n      <script>\n          tailwind.config = {\n              theme: {\n                  extend: {\n                      fontFamily: {\n                          inter: ['Inter', 'sans-serif'],\n                      },\n                  },\n              },\n          };\n      </script>\n  </head>\n  <body class=\"relative font-inter antialiased\">\n      <main class=\"relative min-h-screen flex flex-col justify-center bg-slate-50 overflow-hidden\">\n          <div class=\"w-full max-w-2xl mx-auto px-4 md:px-6 py-24\">\n              <h1 class=\"text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4\">FAQs</h1>\n              <!-- Accordion component -->\n          </div>\n      </main>\n  </body>\n  </html>\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\n\nNow, let’s replace that comment with the accordion code. Here’s what it looks like:  \n\n```\n  <div>\n      <!-- Accordion item -->\n      <div>\n          <h2>\n              <button id=\"faqs-title-01\" type=\"button\">\n                  What are the advantages of your service?\n              </button>\n          </h2>\n          <div id=\"faqs-text-01\" role=\"region\">\n              <p>\n                  If you go over your organisations or user limit, a member of the team will reach out about bespoke pricing. In the meantime, our collaborative features won't appear in accounts or users that are over the 100-account or 1,000-user limit.\n              </p>\n          </div>\n      </div>                                                                                              \n  </div>\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\n\nWe’ve kept the HTML structure simple and lightweight. Each accordion item consists of a `button` element, which serves as the title, and a `div` element as a container for the item’s content.\n\n### [](https://dev.to/cruip_com/building-a-simple-animated-accordion-component-with-tailwind-css-2af7#styling-the-accordion-with-tailwind-css)Styling the accordion with Tailwind CSS\n\nLet’s proceed by **adding some style** with Tailwind CSS classes, and an **SVG icon** to indicate whether each accordion item is open or closed:  \n\n```\n  <div class=\"divide-y divide-slate-200\">\n      <!-- Accordion item -->\n      <div class=\"py-2\">\n          <h2>\n              <button\n                  id=\"faqs-title-01\"\n                  type=\"button\"\n                  class=\"flex items-center justify-between w-full text-left font-semibold py-2\"\n              >\n                  <span>What are the advantages of your service?</span>\n                  <svg class=\"fill-indigo-500 shrink-0 ml-8\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n                      <rect y=\"7\" width=\"16\" height=\"2\" rx=\"1\" class=\"transform origin-center transition duration-200 ease-out\" />\n                      <rect y=\"7\" width=\"16\" height=\"2\" rx=\"1\" class=\"transform origin-center rotate-90 transition duration-200 ease-out\" />\n                  </svg>\n              </button>\n          </h2>\n          <div\n              id=\"faqs-text-01\"\n              role=\"region\"\n              class=\"grid text-sm text-slate-600 overflow-hidden transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out\"\n          >\n              <p class=\"pb-3\">\n                  If you go over your organisations or user limit, a member of the team will reach out about bespoke pricing. In the meantime, our collaborative features won't appear in accounts or users that are over the 100-account or 1,000-user limit.\n              </p>\n          </div>\n      </div>                                                                                              \n  </div>\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\n\nNow, with the code above, we’ve got a single accordion item, expanded by default, and a neat SVG icon representing the plus symbol. It’s starting to look good! However, while we could continue working solely in CSS to make the accordion fully functional, we have accessibility in mind. This is why we’ll need to add a bit JavaScript logic.\n\n### [](https://dev.to/cruip_com/building-a-simple-animated-accordion-component-with-tailwind-css-2af7#using-alpinejs-to-handle-accordion-functionality)Using Alpine.js to handle accordion functionality\n\nAlpine.js is our go-to lightweight JavaScript framework that perfectly complements Tailwind CSS, enabling us to add interactivity without writing a single line of JavaScript.\n\nTo **manage each accordion item separately**, our approach is to define an `expanded` variable for each item, indicating whether it’s open or closed. Thanks to Alpine.js’ `x-data` directive, this is super easy!\n\nThen, we’ll make the following implementations:\n\n-   We’ll toggle the value of the `expanded` variable when the user clicks on the accordion item’s title, using the `@click` directive.\n-   We’ll manage the Tailwind classes on the SVG icon, so that it smoothly transitions from a plus symbol to a minus symbol when the accordion item opens.\n-   Based on the value of the `expanded` variable, we’ll show or hide the accordion item’s content using the `x-show` directive.\n\n```\n  <div class=\"divide-y divide-slate-200\">\n      <!-- Accordion item -->\n      <div x-data=\"{ expanded: false }\" class=\"py-2\">\n          <h2>\n              <button\n                  id=\"faqs-title-01\"\n                  type=\"button\"\n                  class=\"flex items-center justify-between w-full text-left font-semibold py-2\"\n                  @click=\"expanded = !expanded\"\n              >\n                  <span>What are the advantages of your service?</span>\n                  <svg class=\"fill-indigo-500 shrink-0 ml-8\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n                      <rect y=\"7\" width=\"16\" height=\"2\" rx=\"1\" class=\"transform origin-center transition duration-200 ease-out\" :class=\"{'!rotate-180': expanded}\" />\n                      <rect y=\"7\" width=\"16\" height=\"2\" rx=\"1\" class=\"transform origin-center rotate-90 transition duration-200 ease-out\" :class=\"{'!rotate-180': expanded}\" />\n                  </svg>\n              </button>\n          </h2>\n          <div\n              id=\"faqs-text-01\"\n              role=\"region\"\n              class=\"text-sm text-slate-600 overflow-hidden transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out\"\n              x-show=\"expanded\"\n          >\n              <p class=\"pb-3\">\n                  If you go over your organisations or user limit, a member of the team will reach out about bespoke pricing. In the meantime, our collaborative features won't appear in accounts or users that are over the 100-account or 1,000-user limit.\n              </p>\n          </div>\n      </div>                                                                                              \n  </div>\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\n\nIt works like a charm! But hold on, remember, we promised to make it animated! So, we’ll remove the `x-show` directive and try out a different strategy. We could certainly use Alpine.js’ `x-transition` directives, but ee’ve got something even simpler in mind.\n\n### [](https://dev.to/cruip_com/building-a-simple-animated-accordion-component-with-tailwind-css-2af7#managing-the-accordion-animation-with-tailwind-classes)Managing the accordion animation with Tailwind classes\n\nThe idea is to animate the height and opacity of the accordion item’s content. But **animating the height of an HTML element can be a bit tricky**, especially when dealing with the `height: auto` property.\n\nWe can’t simply toggle the `h-0` and `h-auto` classes to animate the height of an HTML element from 0 to 100%. The `height: auto` property doesn’t provide a numeric value that can be interpolated during transitions, making the animation challenging without JavaScript.\n\nNow, the question is: _are there other CSS solutions that allow us to animate the height of an HTML element?_ Actually, [there are a couple](https://css-tricks.com/using-css-transitions-auto-dimensions/), but there’s one we particularly like, and it’s not widely mentioned.\n\nI’m talking about using **CSS grid**. Yes, you heard it right! It’s a trick that involves creating a CSS grid with a single grid item and applying a transition to the `grid-template-rows` property from `0fr` to `1fr`.\n\nLet’s see how it works:  \n\n```\n  <div\n      id=\"faqs-text-01\"\n      role=\"region\"\n      class=\"grid text-sm text-slate-600 overflow-hidden transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out\"\n      :class=\"expanded ? 'grid-rows-[1fr] opacity-100' : 'grid-rows-[0fr] opacity-0'\"\n  >\n      <div class=\"overflow-hidden\">\n          <p class=\"pb-3\">\n              If you go over your organisations or user limit, a member of the team will reach out about bespoke pricing. In the meantime, our collaborative features won't appear in accounts or users that are over the 100-account or 1,000-user limit.\n          </p>\n      </div>\n  </div>\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\n\nHere’s what we’ve done:\n\n-   We added the `grid` class to the HTML element containing the accordion item’s content.\n-   By using Tailwind’s arbitrary values, we applied the `grid-rows-[1fr]` and `grid-rows-[0fr]` classes to control the height of the HTML element based on the current state of the `expanded` variable.\n-   To ensure that the animation works flawlessly, we included the `overflow-hidden` class on the HTML element containing the accordion item’s content.\n\nOne crucial thing to keep in mind is that you shouldn’t apply the `overflow: hidden` property directly to the element defining the padding. This is why we added an additional `div` to achieve the desired effect flawlessly.\n\n### [](https://dev.to/cruip_com/building-a-simple-animated-accordion-component-with-tailwind-css-2af7#making-the-accordion-fully-accessible)Making the accordion fully accessible\n\nIn the final step of our tutorial, we’re going to ensure that our accordion meets accessibility requirements, making it usable and inclusive for all users, including those who rely on assistive technologies like screen readers.\n\nTo make the accordion fully accessible, we need to implement the following integrations:\n\n-   First, we’ll add the `aria-expanded` attribute to the button that acts as the title for each accordion item. This attribute will be linked to the value of the `expanded` variable, indicating whether the item is open or closed.\n-   Next, we’ll add the `aria-controls` attribute to the same button. This attribute will be linked to the ID of the HTML element containing the content of the accordion item. It helps establish the relationship between the button and its associated content.\n-   Finally, we’ll add the `aria-labelledby` attribute to the HTML element containing the accordion item’s content. This attribute will be linked to the ID of the button that serves as the title for the accordion item, creating a link between the content and its corresponding title.\n\n```\n  <div class=\"divide-y divide-slate-200\">\n      <!-- Accordion item -->\n      <div x-data=\"{ expanded: false }\" class=\"py-2\">\n          <h2>\n              <button\n                  id=\"faqs-title-01\"\n                  type=\"button\"\n                  class=\"flex items-center justify-between w-full text-left font-semibold py-2\"\n                  @click=\"expanded = !expanded\"\n                  :aria-expanded=\"expanded\"\n                  aria-controls=\"faqs-text-01\"\n              >\n                  <span>What are the advantages of your service?</span>\n                  <svg class=\"fill-indigo-500 shrink-0 ml-8\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n                      <rect y=\"7\" width=\"16\" height=\"2\" rx=\"1\" class=\"transform origin-center transition duration-200 ease-out\" :class=\"{'!rotate-180': expanded}\" />\n                      <rect y=\"7\" width=\"16\" height=\"2\" rx=\"1\" class=\"transform origin-center rotate-90 transition duration-200 ease-out\" :class=\"{'!rotate-180': expanded}\" />\n                  </svg>\n              </button>\n          </h2>\n          <div\n              id=\"faqs-text-01\"\n              role=\"region\"\n              aria-labelledby=\"faqs-title-01\"\n              class=\"grid text-sm text-slate-600 overflow-hidden transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out\"\n              :class=\"expanded ?

Users of all abilities can interact with it comfortably, and assistive technologies will be able to provide a smooth experience.\n\nNow, the only thing left to do is to add additional accordion items, ensuring that each of them has a **unique ID**.\n\n___\n\n## [](https://dev.to/cruip_com/building-a-simple-animated-accordion-component-with-tailwind-css-2af7#creating-a-nextjs-accordion-component)Creating a Next.js accordion component\n\nIf you’re working with Next.js, you can take advantage of the HTML code we’ve created so far, but with some modifications to transform it into a **functional React component**. We’ll utilize React hooks, specifically `useState` and `useEffect`, to handle the accordion’s functionality. Additionally, we’ll use TypeScript to define the types of props, reducing the chance of errors.\n\nLet’s walk through the process of converting the HTML code into a React component:  \n\n```\n  'use client'\n  import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'\n  export default function Accordion() {\n    const [accordionOpen, setAccordionOpen] = useState<boolean>(false)\n    useEffect(() => {\n      setAccordionOpen(false)\n    }, [])\n    return (\n      <div className=\"py-2\">\n        <h2>\n          <button\n            className=\"flex items-center justify-between w-full text-left font-semibold py-2\"\n            onClick={(e) => { e.preventDefault(); setAccordionOpen(!accordionOpen); }}\n            aria-expanded={accordionOpen}\n            aria-controls={`accordion-text-01`}\n          >\n            <span>What are the advantages of your service?</span>\n            <svg className=\"fill-indigo-500 shrink-0 ml-8\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n              <rect y=\"7\" width=\"16\" height=\"2\" rx=\"1\" className={`ttransform origin-center transition duration-200 ease-out ${accordionOpen && '!rotate-180'}`} />\n              <rect y=\"7\" width=\"16\" height=\"2\" rx=\"1\" className={`transform origin-center rotate-90 transition duration-200 ease-out ${accordionOpen && '!rotate-180'}`} />\n            </svg>           \n          </button>        \n        </h2>\n        <div\n          id={`accordion-text-01`}\n          role=\"region\"\n          aria-labelledby={`accordion-title-01`}\n          className={`grid text-sm text-slate-600 overflow-hidden transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out ${accordionOpen ? 'grid-rows-[1fr] opacity-100' : 'grid-rows-[0fr] opacity-0'}`}\n        >\n          <div className=\"overflow-hidden\">\n            <p className=\"pb-3\">\n              If you go over your organisations or user limit, a member of the team will reach out about bespoke pricing. In the meantime, our collaborative features won't appear in accounts or users that are over the 100-account or 1,000-user limit.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\n\nAs you can see, we’ve defined a variable called `accordionOpen`, which will keep track of whether the accordion item is open or closed. Additionally, we’ve used the `useState` hook to initialize its state. Furthermore, we added a `useEffect` hook to reset the value of `accordionOpen` when the component is mounted, ensuring proper initialization.\n\nNow, this component can be easily used on any Next.js page by simply importing and rendering it like this:  \n\n```\n  <Accordion />\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\n\nIt works beautifully! However, you may need to use this accordion component on multiple pages, and in that case, it’s helpful to **turn it into a reusable component**. To achieve this, we can **add props** to the component, allowing us to define the title, ID, and content of each accordion item. Additionally, we’ve introduced an `active` prop, enabling us to specify whether the accordion item should be open or closed by default.  \n\n```\n  'use client'\n  import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'\n  type AccordionpProps = {\n    children: React.ReactNode\n    title: string\n    id: string,\n    active?: boolean\n  }\n  export default function Accordion({\n    children,\n    title,\n    id,\n    active = false\n  }: AccordionpProps) {\n    const [accordionOpen, setAccordionOpen] = useState<boolean>(false)\n    useEffect(() => {\n      setAccordionOpen(active)\n    }, [])\n    return (\n      <div className=\"py-2\">\n        <h2>\n          <button\n            className=\"flex items-center justify-between w-full text-left font-semibold py-2\"\n            onClick={(e) => { e.preventDefault(); setAccordionOpen(!accordionOpen); }}\n            aria-expanded={accordionOpen}\n            aria-controls={`accordion-text-${id}`}\n          >\n            <span>{title}</span>\n            <svg className=\"fill-indigo-500 shrink-0 ml-8\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n              <rect y=\"7\" width=\"16\" height=\"2\" rx=\"1\" className={`ttransform origin-center transition duration-200 ease-out ${accordionOpen && '!rotate-180'}`} />\n              <rect y=\"7\" width=\"16\" height=\"2\" rx=\"1\" className={`transform origin-center rotate-90 transition duration-200 ease-out ${accordionOpen && '!rotate-180'}`} />\n            </svg>\n          </button>\n        </h2>\n        <div\n          id={`accordion-text-${id}`}\n          role=\"region\"\n          aria-labelledby={`accordion-title-${id}`}\n          className={`grid text-sm text-slate-600 overflow-hidden transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out ${accordionOpen ? 'grid-rows-[1fr] opacity-100' : 'grid-rows-[0fr] opacity-0'}`}\n        >\n          <div className=\"overflow-hidden\">\n            <p className=\"pb-3\">\n              {children}\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\n\nTo use the component, you simply need to import it into a parent component and pass the necessary props. Here’s an example of how to use it:  \n\n```\n  export const metadata = {\n    title: 'Animated Accordion - Cruip Tutorials',\n    description: 'Page description',\n  }\n  import Accordion from '@/components/accordion'\n  export default function AnimatedAccordionPage() {\n    const faqs = [\n      {\n        title: \"What are the advantages of your service?\",\n        text: \"If you go over your organisations or user limit, a member of the team will reach out about bespoke pricing.

It is available in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cruip/cruip-tutorials-next/blob/main/components/accordion.tsx) that includes all Next.js examples from our tutorials.\n\n___\n\n## [](https://dev.to/cruip_com/building-a-simple-animated-accordion-component-with-tailwind-css-2af7#creating-a-vue-accordion-component)Creating a Vue accordion component\n\nIf you’re working with Vue, creating an accordion component is straightforward, similar to what we did for React. We’ll use the **Composition API** with the `script setup` syntax, along with **TypeScript** support for added type safety.\n\nLet’s take a look at the code for the initial Vue accordion component:  \n\n```\n  <script setup lang=\"ts\">\n  import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'\n  const accordionOpen = ref<boolean>(false)\n  onMounted(() => {\n    accordionOpen.value = false\n  })\n  </script>\n  <template>\n    <div class=\"py-2\">\n      <h2>\n        <button\n          id=\"accordion-title-01\"\n          class=\"flex items-center justify-between w-full text-left font-semibold py-2\"\n          @click.prevent=\"accordionOpen = !accordionOpen\"\n          :aria-expanded=\"accordionOpen\"\n          aria-controls=\"accordion-text-01\"\n        >\n          <span>What are the advantages of your service?</span>\n          <svg class=\"fill-indigo-500 shrink-0 ml-8\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n              <rect y=\"7\" width=\"16\" height=\"2\" rx=\"1\" class=\"transform origin-center transition duration-200 ease-out\" :class=\"{ '!rotate-180': accordionOpen }\" />\n              <rect y=\"7\" width=\"16\" height=\"2\" rx=\"1\" class=\"transform origin-center rotate-90 transition duration-200 ease-out\" :class=\"{ '!rotate-180': accordionOpen }\" />\n          </svg>      \n        </button>\n      </h2>\n      <div\n        id=\"accordion-text-01\"\n        role=\"region\"\n        aria-labelledby=\"accordion-title-01\"\n        class=\"grid text-sm text-slate-600 overflow-hidden transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out\"    \n        :class=\"accordionOpen ? 'grid-rows-[1fr] opacity-100' : 'grid-rows-[0fr] opacity-0'\"\n      >\n        <div class=\"overflow-hidden\">\n          <p class=\"pb-3\">\n            If you go over your organisations or user limit, a member of the team will reach out about bespoke pricing. In the meantime, our collaborative features won't appear in accounts or users that are over the 100-account or 1,000-user limit.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>    \n    </div>\n  </template>\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\n\nAs you can see, we’ve defined the `accordionOpen` variable using the `ref` function from Vue’s Composition API. This variable keeps track of whether the accordion item is open or closed. Additionally, we’ve included the necessary logic to toggle its state when the user clicks on the accordion title.\n\nThis component can be conveniently used on any Vue page by importing and including it like this:  \n\n```\n  <Accordion />\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\n\nNow, let’s proceed to transform this component into a **fully reusable** one, just as we did for the React version. We’ll make the same modifications, creating a Vue counterpart of the reusable accordion component:  \n\n```\n  <script setup lang=\"ts\">\n  import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'\n  const accordionOpen = ref<boolean>(false)\n  const props = defineProps<{\n    title: string\n    id: string\n    active?: boolean\n  }>()\n  onMounted(() => {\n    accordionOpen.value = props.active\n  })\n  </script>\n  <template>\n    <div class=\"py-2\">\n      <h2>\n        <button\n          :id=\"`accordion-title-${id}`\"\n          class=\"flex items-center justify-between w-full text-left font-semibold py-2\"\n          @click.prevent=\"accordionOpen = !accordionOpen\"\n          :aria-expanded=\"accordionOpen\"\n          :aria-controls=\"`accordion-text-${id}`\"\n        >\n          <span>{{ title }}</span>\n          <svg class=\"fill-indigo-500 shrink-0 ml-8\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n              <rect y=\"7\" width=\"16\" height=\"2\" rx=\"1\" class=\"transform origin-center transition duration-200 ease-out\" :class=\"{ '!rotate-180': accordionOpen }\" />\n              <rect y=\"7\" width=\"16\" height=\"2\" rx=\"1\" class=\"transform origin-center rotate-90 transition duration-200 ease-out\" :class=\"{ '!rotate-180': accordionOpen }\" />\n          </svg>      \n        </button>\n      </h2>\n      <div\n        :id=\"`accordion-text-${id}`\"\n        role=\"region\"\n        :aria-labelledby=\"`accordion-title-${id}`\"\n        class=\"grid text-sm text-slate-600 overflow-hidden transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out\"    \n        :class=\"accordionOpen ? 'grid-rows-[1fr] opacity-100' : 'grid-rows-[0fr] opacity-0'\"\n      >\n        <div class=\"overflow-hidden\">\n          <p class=\"pb-3\">\n            <slot />\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>    \n    </div>\n  </template>\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\n\nBy adding props to the component, we can now define the title, ID, and content of each accordion item dynamically. The `active` prop also allows us to control whether the accordion item should be open or closed by default.\n\nTo use the reusable Vue accordion component, import it into a parent component, and pass the necessary props like this:  \n\n```\n  <script setup lang=\"ts\">\n  import Accordion from '../components/Accordion.vue'\n  const faqs = [\n    {\n      title: \"What are the advantages of your service?\",\n      text: \"If you go over your organisations or user limit, a member of the team will reach out about bespoke pricing.

      "raw": "\n# Introduction\n\nThe tailwind starter blog has out of the box support for [Next.js's built-in image component](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image) and automatically swaps out default image tags in markdown or mdx documents to use the Image component provided.\n\n# Usage\n\nTo use in a new page route / javascript file, simply import the image component and call it e.g.\n\n```js\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n\nfunction Home() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>My Homepage</h1>\n      <Image src=\"/me.png\" alt=\"Picture of the author\" width={500} height={500} />\n      <p>Welcome to my homepage!</p>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Home\n```\n\nFor a markdown file, the default image tag can be used and the default `img` tag gets replaced by the `Image` component in the build process.\n\nAssuming we have a file called `ocean.jpg` in `data/img/ocean.jpg`, the following line of code would generate the optimized image.\n\n```\n![ocean](/static/images/ocean.jpg)\n```\n\nAlternatively, since we are using mdx, we can just use the image component directly! Note, that you would have to provide a fixed width and height. The `img` tag method parses the dimension automatically.\n\n```js\n<Image alt=\"ocean\" src=\"/static/images/ocean.jpg\" width={256} height={128} />\n```\n\n_Note_: If you try to save the image, it is in webp format, if your browser supports it!\n\n![car](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1694033996901-60322b8740dc?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1172&q=80)\n\nPhoto by [Karsten Winegeart](https://unsplash.com/photos/a-blue-land-rover-parked-in-front-of-a-mountain-C-we3byAFyg)\non [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@karsten116)\n\n# Benefits\n\n- Smaller image size with Webp (~30% smaller than jpeg)\n- Responsive images - the correct image size is served based on the user's viewport\n- Lazy loading - images load as they are scrolled to the viewport\n- Avoids [Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/)\n- Optimization on demand instead of build-time - no increase in build time!\n\n# Limitations\n\n- Due to the reliance on `next/image`, unless you are using an external image CDN like Cloudinary or Imgix, it is practically required to use Vercel for hosting. This is because the component acts like a serverless function that calls a highly optimized image CDN.\n\n  If you do not want to be tied to Vercel, you can remove `imgToJsx` in `remarkPlugins` in `lib/mdx.js`. This would avoid substituting the default `img` tag.\n\n  Alternatively, one could wait for image optimization at build time to be supported. A different library, [next-optimized-images](https://github.com/cyrilwanner/next-optimized-images) does that, although it requires transforming the images through webpack which is not done here.\n\n- Images from external links are not passed through `next/image`\n- All images have to be stored in the `public` folder e.g `/static/images/ocean.jpeg`\n",

Because this tool is open source and everyone is more than welcome to contribute to it!\n\nYou can grab an issue at any time, or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/bqwyEa6We6) server to discuss the project and its future. Nothing is set in stone, so feel free to share your ideas and suggestions.\n\n## Technologies involved\n\nThe app is currently based on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS (actually with [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/), a Tailwind CSS component library).\n\nWe manage some data, specifically from the [GitHub APIs](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql) using the [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) endpoint and [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/).\n\nThere's a login feature with [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/) using GitHub as a provider.\n\n### Coming soon\n\nThe plan is to also add at…\n\n[View on GitHub](https://github.com/Balastrong/github-stats)\n\nHere's a quick overview of the project:\n\n<iframe width=\"710\" height=\"399\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZM92XPdrOTk\" allowfullscreen=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" ></iframe>\n\n## [](https://dev.to/this-is-learning/learning-web-development-together-with-a-real-project-1bf8#why-this-project)Why this project?\n\nAs of today it's still pretty basic because that's exactly the point, building it together! I already mentioned some of the technologies involved but I'm planning to add more, everything will be kept up to date in the README file.\n\nI've written a lot of tutorials and I think they can be helpful, but the final step is always to put the concepts into practice and I think this project can be a good starting point.\n\nYou can use it to learn or improve your technical skills, but it is also a great chance to start contributing to Open Source in a controlled environment. It can help getting familiar with the process of contributing to a project between issues, pull requests, code reviews and so on.\n\nLike I say many times in the video, the goal isn't the success of the final product but rather the process of building it together.\n\nI'm also not necessarily an expert in all the technologies I'd like to see in the project, so I'm also going to learn a lot from it and I really can't wait to see your contributions!\n\n## [](https://dev.to/this-is-learning/learning-web-development-together-with-a-real-project-1bf8#how-to-contribute)How to contribute\n\nIf you want to participate, you can find the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/Balastrong/github-stats/blob/main/README.md) and in the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/Balastrong/github-stats/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) files, including some instructions on how to set up the environment variables (most notably, the tokens for the GitHub login as we'll see later).\n\nThe project is open to any kind of contribution, from fixing typos to adding new features, so don't be shy and feel free to contribute!\n\nYou can do basically everything at this point, for example:\n\n-   Open an issue to report a bug or suggest a new feature\n-   Answer or provide feedback on issues (there are some open questions)\n-   Comment on an issue to get it assigned so you can start working on it\n-   Open a pull request to fix a bug or add a new feature (make sure to link the assignedissue)\n-   Do some code review on a pull request\n\n## [](https://dev.to/this-is-learning/learning-web-development-together-with-a-real-project-1bf8#what-is-the-project-about)What is the project about?\n\nAh right, I didn't mention it yet! I felt what said here above was actually more important than the project itself, but I guess it's time to talk about it.\n\nThere's a hosted version here: [https://public-github-stats.vercel.app/](https://public-github-stats.vercel.app/)\n\nThe overall idea is that it might be useful to have some relevant data, extracted and grouped from the official GitHub APIs, to use it in your CV or portfolio. Putting the GitHub link is already fine (mandatory, I would say), but also adding some meaningful metrics can be a nice touch.\n\nFrom the Homepage you'll be able to login with your GitHub Account so that your data can be pulled directly from the GitHub GraphQL endpoint.\n\nAs of today there's a page listing the repositories where you opened some pull requests with the state and a total counter, grouped by year. You can nicely display in the browser or export as JSON or text ([implemented a couple of days ago](https://github.com/Balastrong/github-stats/pull/19)).\n\n\n\nCreated a generate text function and a button to export it. Added a button for downloading in json format as well. :)\n\n[View on GitHub](https://github.com/Balastrong/github-stats/pull/19)\n\nThere's also a profile page with some basic data and actually a lot of space to put some more!\n\nIn the future we can indeed add some other combined data, animations, charts and so on... or think even bigger and adding job postings or other related (or unrelated) featues! If you have any idea, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/Balastrong/github-stats/issues) and discuss it.\n\nSpeaking of communication, to make things move faster we can also use [Discord](https://discord.gg/5CceB5Y6Zt).\n\nDo you think it's a good idea? Do you have any suggestions? Let me know in the comments and see you in the project!\n\n___\n\nThanks for reading this article, I hope you found it interesting!\n\nI recently launched my Discord server to talk about Open Source and Web Development, feel free to join: [https://discord.gg/bqwyEa6We6](https://discord.gg/bqwyEa6We6)\n\nDo you like my content?

Naughty Dog a anunțat într-o declarație că lucrează la un patch confirmând toate aceste probleme.\r\n\r\nÎntre timp, să amintim că studioul Iron Galaxy a portat jocul [Batman](https://geeki.ro/tag/batman/ \"Batman\") Arkham Knight pe PC în 2015.

Unii utilizatori spun că procesorul este folosit 100% chiar și în meniul jocului. Un alt jucător spune că jocul s-a prăbușit de 12 ori pe parcursul a 3,5 ore de joc. În ciuda problemelor, The Last of Us Part 1 pare să aibă un început comercial puternic, atingând un vârf de 36.496 de utilizatori în prima zi, potrivit SteamDB.

This allows for better castability. The overall density of the balsa makes super-accurate, bullet-like casts possible, so getting into those hard-to-reach places is easier.\n\nAlso the movement in water is far more better compared to hollow plastic .\n\n![trout lures](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0513/0652/8917/files/Trout_lures_romania_480x480.jpg?v=1620904721)\n\nI start with cutting the balsa wood shape for each model. Then I insert a stainless wire and the weight system, followed by aluminum foil to mimic the undewater flash that atracts fish but also the scales texture and the head and gills shape to create a more real feel .\n\n![hand made lures](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0513/0652/8917/files/hand_made_lures_480x480.jpg?v=1620904945)\n\nThen, I add a layer of epoxy resin to add resistance to the body and foil.\n\nOnce this is done, I start the painting process - this is the fun part; I usually follow certain colour schemes which I know that work for me ,i search and try to imitate the most common minnow patterns that can be found in trout streams or lakes in different parts of the world like the vairon that has lots of subspecies  ,also try to make trout patterns as i know trout eat their own juveniles like brown trout ,rainbow trouts brook trout . But also make custom colours at the customer request and clasic colours that are already tested for many years .\n\n![colour salmon lure](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0513/0652/8917/files/colour_salmon_lure_480x480.jpg?v=1620905193)\n\nThe end result is indeed satisfying - and it gives me immense pleasure to capture fish with every occasion in all different weather and light conditions .\n\n I delivered orders all over the world in UK, France, Ireland, Sweden, Poland, and all the way to Australia and the US.\n\nmost my lures are fitted with tiple hooks but at request i can add single hooks ,normal singles or barbless .\n\n![order hand made lures](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0513/0652/8917/files/order_hand_made_lures_480x480.jpg?v=1620905370)\n\nFeel free to reach out for custom orders or - [contact page](https://panlures.com/pages/contact).",

      "raw": "\n\nRecently I worked with a client with a Data Analytics team using the data visualisation tool PowerBI. PowerBI is a Business Intelligence desktop application for Microsoft Windows that allows users to generate graphics and reports for a variety of data sources.\n\nThe client wished to generate reports on the data in their production PostgreSQL database that we provisioned for them in AWS RDS. They therefore required a solution that would allow their Analytics team to query the database from their local machines.\n\nThe solution had to balance of number of priorities:\n\n1. _Security_ - The production data was highly sensitive and it was important to not risk a data breach.\n2. _Convenience_ - Ideally the solution would require minimal effort on the side of the PowerBI team to implement on their local machines.\n3. _Speed of implementation_ - We had a two day goal for the integration to be completed.\n4. _Cost_ - AWS bill should not increase too much.\n\nI found that provisioning an _AWS Client VPN_ for the PowerBI team to connect to and query the database through was the ideal balance of these four priorities.\n\n## Decision Process\n\nThe AWS [whitepaper](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/whitepapers/latest/using-power-bi-with-aws-cloud/using-power-bi-with-aws-cloud.pdf#using-power-bi-with-aws-cloud) on the topic of using PowerBI in the AWS Cloud provides four main options for connecting PowerBI and RDS, which are as follows:\n\n### Whitelist IP access for certain users\n\n<div className=\"flex w-full\">\n  <div className=\"flex-1 w-full\">\n    <h4>Pros</h4>\n    <ul>\n      <li>✅ Easy to set up</li>\n      <li>✅ Cheap</li>\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n  <div className=\"flex-1 w-full\">\n    <h4>Cons</h4>\n    <ul>\n      <li>❌ Not very secure</li>\n      <li>\n        ❌ Requires manual maintenance of IP whitelist in AWS (annoying if IPs rotate, or some\n        members of the team sometimes work from home)\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n### Configure SSH access for certain users\n\n<div className=\"flex w-full\">\n  <div className=\"flex-1 w-full\">\n    <h4>Pros</h4>\n    <ul>\n      <li>✅ Pretty easy to set up</li>\n      <li>✅ Cheap</li>\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n  <div className=\"flex-1 w-full\">\n    <h4>Cons</h4>\n    <ul>\n      <li>❌ Not very secure</li>\n      <li>\n        ❌ Users have to install an SSH client such as PuTTY which has a fairly complicated\n        configuration process\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n### Provision an AWS Client VPN endpoint that users can connect to\n\n<div className=\"flex w-full\">\n  <div className=\"flex-1 w-full\">\n    <h4>Pros</h4>\n    <ul>\n      <li>✅ Pretty secure</li>\n      <li>✅ Pretty easy to set up</li>\n      <li>✅ Fairly Cheap (70$/mo for associating with a single subnet)</li>\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n  <div className=\"flex-1 w-full\">\n    <h4>Cons</h4>\n    <ul>\n      <li>❌ Users have to install VPN client and connect while using PowerBI</li>\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n### Provision a Microsoft On-premises Data Gateway in AWS\n\n<div className=\"flex w-full\">\n  <div className=\"flex-1 w-full\">\n    <h4>Pros</h4>\n    <ul>\n      <li>✅ Pretty secure</li>\n      <li>✅ Users don’t have to install anything</li>\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n  <div className=\"flex-1 w-full\">\n    <h4>Cons</h4>\n    <ul>\n      <li>❌ Very expensive (~$400/mo)</li>\n      <li>❌ Difficult to set up</li>\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\nFrom the above analysis I concluded that provisioning an AWS Client VPN satisfied three out of our four priorities. I mitigated the downside of VPN configuration on the client side by providing good documentation to the PowerBI users for connecting to the VPN.\n\n## Provisioning an AWS Client VPN using Terraform\n\nIdeally PowerBI users should not be querying your actual production database. This is in case any of them manage to write an expensive query and lock the database, causing downtime for your production users.\n\nTherefore we have our first step:\n\n### Step 1: Provision a read replica of your database in RDS.\n\nI am now in the habit of using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to provision infrastructure in AWS which brings all the benefits of infrastructure as code, including versioning, automation and many more.\n\nIn Terraform provisioning a read replica is as easy as specifying another RDS resource block and setting the `replicate_source_db` option to the id of your production database.\n\n### Step 2: Provision an AWS Client VPN\n\nTo use mutual authentication two certificates must be defined in Terraform:\n\n```jsx\nresource \"aws_acm_certificate\" \"server\" {\n  domain_name = \"server\"\n}\n\nresource \"aws_acm_certificate\" \"client\" {\n  domain_name = \"client1.domain.tld\"\n}\n```\n\nWe then define a `aws_ec2_client_vpn_endpoint` resource:\n\n```jsx\nresource \"aws_ec2_client_vpn_endpoint\" \"vpn\" {\n  description       = \"PowerBI VPN\"\n  client_cidr_block = \"10.0.0.0/22\"\n  split_tunnel      = true\n\n  server_certificate_arn = aws_acm_certificate.server.arn\n\n  connection_log_options {\n    enabled = false\n  }\n\n  authentication_options {\n    type                       = \"certificate-authentication\"\n    root_certificate_chain_arn = aws_acm_certificate.client.arn\n  }\n\n  dns_servers = [\n    \"1.1.1.1\",\n    \"8.8.8.8\",\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nWhere we use `split_tunnel` to ensure only RDS traffic gets routed through the VPN. We don’t want to pay the data transfer costs for all other traffic!\n\nWe also need an authorisation rule:\n\n```jsx\nresource \"aws_ec2_client_vpn_authorization_rule\" \"default\" {\n  client_vpn_endpoint_id = aws_ec2_client_vpn_endpoint.vpn.id\n  target_network_cidr    = \"10.0.0.0/16\"\n  authorize_all_groups   = true\n}\n```\n\nAnd finally a network association:\n\n```jsx\nresource \"aws_ec2_client_vpn_network_association\" \"default\" {\n  client_vpn_endpoint_id = aws_ec2_client_vpn_endpoint.vpn.id\n  subnet_id              = var.vpc_private_subnet\n  security_groups        = [var.security_group_id]\n}\n```\n\nMake sure the `subnet_id` is the subnet containing your RDS instance! Also, make sure to allow traffic from the security group you specify in `security_groups` as ingress to your production database security group. A secure implementation will only allow ingress via the database port e.g. for Postgres it would be as follows:\n\n```jsx\ningress {\n    from_port       = 5432\n    to_port         = 5432\n    protocol        = \"tcp\"\n    security_groups = [var.security_group_id]\n  }\n```\n\n### Step 3: Create a VPN Configuration File\n\nSteps to do this can be found in the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-admin/cvpn-getting-started.html) (step 7).\n\n### Step 4: Download a VPN Client and connect to the VPN\n\nAWS provides a [VPN client](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-user/connect-aws-client-vpn-connect.html) for Windows, Mac and Linux. Once downloaded you should be able to connect to your VPN!\n\n### Step 5: On Windows, add the RDS Public Key to our trusted root certificates\n\n1. Download the [RDS Public Key](https://s3.amazonaws.com/rds-downloads/rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem)\n2. [Convert](https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-converter.html) the key to P7B/PKCS#7\n3. Open `mmc` from the cmd prompt\n4. File > Add/Remove Snap In\n5. Certificates > Add > Computer Account > Local Computer > OK\n6. Right click on Trusted Root Certification Authorities > All Tasks > Import\n7. Select the certificate you just converted > Place all certificates in the following store\n\n### Step 6: Add your RDS Database as a data source in PowerBI\n\n1. Obtain the RDS credentials\n2. In PowerBI Get Data > PostgreSQL Database (or your DB type)\n3. Fill in the credentials\n4. Query away!\n\nMake sure you share the database credentials and VPN configuration file securely between users. Now you are all set up!\n",
